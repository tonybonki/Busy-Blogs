<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is just one of many websites that I will be creating to practice and also show off my fullstack website development skills. I called this project Busy Blogs because users will be able to create their own blog posts and post it onto the website. I will any user will be able to view their blog posts andd also other posts on the website and have the option to delete the blog posts.
